# CHADAKOIN
Chadakoin is a libaray to provide remote URL reading abilities to the InputStream class.  Currently the [InputStream](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/inputstream) and [FileHandle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filehandle) classes only read [file URLs (URLs that use the "file://" protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme) but not other protocols such as "http", "https", and "ftp".  For non-file URLs you have to use the [URL Loading System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system) which is a bit like killing house flys with an atom-bomb.  This library attempts to simplify that greatly.

# Why the name Chadakoin?
Borrowing from the concept of being able to read from a stream, the Chadakoin is a river in Western New York which drains [Chautauqua Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chautauqua_Lake), eventually, into the Gulf of Mexico.  See [Chadakoin River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadakoin_River)
